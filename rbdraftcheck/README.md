Add more validation on review request 
============================

Overview
--------

This extension adds a bit more checks when publishing a review request. This generally improves 
code quality and consistency for a review request 

FIXME: this checks should be added in js side but I didn't find good place to be hooked on client side 

Status
------

This extension is new, but should be usable in a production environment.


Requirements
------------

This requires Review Board 2.0 beta 2 or higher.
